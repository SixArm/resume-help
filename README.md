# Resume help

When you apply for a job, you can improve your chances by sending a good resume and related information.

This page has our resume help tips. We use these for our recruiting and hiring.

* Send your resume as a PDF file.

  * Because a PDF file is typically the most-readable and most-scannable.

  * Do not send as any other kind of file, because it may interfere with reading and scanning.

* Format your resume as one page.

  * Because one page is the most-skimmable and most-scannable in order to land an interview. 

  * Do not send more than one page, unless you have extensive extras and you know what you're doing.

* Include your top 3 relevant work samples.

  * Because work samples are among the best ways for teams to evaluate candidates.

  * Do not send too many work samples, because you want the hiring manager to focus on your best work.

* Use a proofreader.

  * Because you want a second set of eyes in order to look for errors or unclear areas.

  * Do not skip this step, because it's so important to being professional.

* Use bullet points. 

  * Because bullet points are easier for a reader to skim, and easier for a scanner to parse.

  * Do not use long paragraphs, because they are harder to skim and scan.
