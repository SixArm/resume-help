## Content


☐ Use your best information.

* ✅ Do put your best, most-relevant, most-important information.

* 🚫 Don't put everything or extraneous information.

☐ Show your top 3 relevant work samples.

* ✅ Work samples are proven to be among the best ways for teams to evaluate candidates.

* 🚫 Don't use more work samples, because you want the hiring manager to focus on your best work.


## Format

☐ Format as one page.

* ✅ One page is the most-skimmable and most-scannable in order to land an interview. 

* 🚫 Don't use more than one page, unless you have extensive extras and you know what you're doing.

☐ Format using bullet points. 

* ✅ Bullet points are easier for a reader to skim, and easier for a scanner to parse.

* 🚫 Don't use long paragraphs, because they are harder to skim and scan.

☐ Use a proofreader.

* ✅ A second set of eyes helps you find errors and fix any unclear areas.

* 🚫 Don't skip this step, because it's so important to being professional.


## File

☐ Create a PDF file.

* ✅ A PDF file is typically the most-readable and most-scannable.

* 🚫 Don't use other kinds of files, because they may interfere with reading and scanning.
